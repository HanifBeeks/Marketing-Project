[Explanation]
Above I broke down the root analysis into smaller questions to give myself structure when answering the question and be able to find insight within the data. To sharpen my strategic thinking in this section, I intend to explain why I asked these questions and how will these questions and data help us make impactful decisions.

➡️ First, identifying the successful and failing marketing campaign will help the company know which campaigns to invest more marketing dollars into and which ones to invest less in. Also, observing the size amount of people accepting and not accpeting the offer from each marketing campaign will help us understand the conversion rate for each, then duplicate the original successful campaign and make improvements to the duplicated one.


➡️ Second, understanding where campaigns are doing successful and failing will show us which campaigns we should be running in each market. Every market is different, people react and are attracted in different ways.


➡️ Third, the demographic helps the company understand their average target market and this will narrow down who our ads need to be in front of and also understand what type of ads need to be shown to keep the audience engaged also get interactions.

➡️ Fourth, analyzing the receny purchase days after the customer makes their first purchase using the accept offer from the successful marketing campaign will let the company know how often retargeting needs to happen and which channel to market through.
